# Toyota-Hackathon

###### Set up

```
cd Toyota-Frontend
npm install
npm run dev

```
**Context:**

This Github contains the contribution of Team RnDAO to the Toyota DAO Hackathon.

The goal of the hackathon was to address two challenges in Toyota:
1. Increasing workload on managers due to an increase in business decision-making and team member management.
2. Help improve the impact that team members have on company growth.

The solution context was set by Toyota as follows:
1. Create an intra-company DAO support tools which Toyota employees may actually use in the future.
2. Create a product that could actually scale to external parties
3. Create a product that members can operate autonomously and decision-making is distributed  

<br/><br/>

**About the RnDAO Team:**

RnDAO is a DAO focused on researching and building DAO tooling. Our members have worked in the DAO space for years and have contributed and built some of the most important tools in the space. The team for this Hackathon was comprised of

* Wutwut: web3 Freelance Product Manager - Ex Google/BCG, 2x Founder
* William: Full-stack Blockchain Developer
* Adebola: Full-stack Blockchain Developer and member of Gitcoinâ€™s FDD unit
* Nikku: Full-stack Blockchain Developer

<br/><br/>

**Proposal Focus:**

In our proposal, we focus on the following problems
How do we help Toyota employees surface problems and solutions that are important to them? How do we do this without managers having to be the middleman of this process?
How do we allow other members to constructively contribute to ideas that have been put forward? How do we do this avoiding the complexity and chaos that plague usual proposal discussions in DAOs?

<br/><br/>

**RnDAO Solution - Toyota IDEA HQ:**

To solve the above mentioned problems, we created the Toyota IDEA HQ. IDEA HQ is a web product built on the MERN stack that uses Astar wallet IDs as user identifiers. The goal of IDEA HQ is to surface the most critical problems that Toyota employees see within the organisation, and allow them to collectively come up with solutions to these problems. All of it is done in a decentralised way, without the need for managers to interfere. 

Core to the Toyota model is the insight that employees on the shop floor - those closest to the real work - can see problems better and faster (Jidoka).  IDEA HQ builds on that insight by helping Toyota employees surface the problems they know are critical, and allowing other employees to craft solutions. Separating problems from solutions means all of it is done in a decentralised way, without the need for managers to interfere. 

More concretely Toyota IDEA HQ allows the following:

1. Any Toyota employee can submit a problem they see in the organisation
2. Employees can upvote problems that they resonate with
3. Any Employee can submit their own solution to any problem
4. Employees can comment and discuss solutions, and help the initial proposer to improve the solution
5. Employees can also upvote solutions to surface the highest priorities

The most upvoted solutions can then be brought to the relevant Toyota committees that can fund and staff relevant teams to execute the ideas, pulling from the pool of people who have upvoted the problem. This part is out of scope of this proposal

Because employees login with their Astar wallets, contributions to Toyota IDEA HQ are mapped to their wallet address, and at a later point can be minted as contribution badges that employees can use to show their skills and level of participation. This part is out of scope of this proposal, but will be implemented as a next step.

<br/><br/>

**Benefit of Toyota IDEA HQ:**

Toyota IDEA HQ has the following benefits
1. The most important problems/challenges are made visible to everyone in the organisation
2. The wisdom of the crowd will determine which problems are most pressing and surface priorities
3. Every employee is empowered to come up with solutions to these problems. Ideas can come from everywhere now.
4. Employees can collaborate on improving ideas and prioritise the most important
5. Managers do not have to intervene in the process saving important time

**How does Toyota IDEA HQ work?:**

The following section will guide you through all the relevant screens of Toyota IDEA HQ from the perspective of a Toyota employee called Kenzo.
<br/><br/>
**Login:**
Ken logs in with his Astar compatible wallet. His address was whitelisted from the Toyota main office and has access to IDEA HQ.

**Home:**
Ken explores the highest trending problems and solutions that his team members across Toyota are surfacing. He can decide to upvote problems/solutions if they resonate with him. He can also add a problem/solution if he has an idea that is not represented in the list.

<br/><br/>
**Problem overview:**
Today Ken decides to add a problem that he encountered to the list - His team is still using outdated modelling software and it causes delays. He goes to the problem overview where he adds the problem and upvotes some that resonate with him.

<br/><br/>
**Solution overview:**
Afterwards Ken goes to the solution overview page where his colleagues have started to come up with ideas on how to address some of the prevailing problems. One particularly resonates with him and he decides to read more details.

<br/><br/>
**Solution details:**
Ken reads through the proposal details and decides to add some comments that he thinks will help his colleagues improve the solution.

<br/><br/>
**Propose solution screen:**
Ken also decides to add his own solution proposal. He links the problems the solution solves, and fills in the required fields. In a few clicks he submits the proposal.

<br/><br/>
**Next Steps:**
Now Ken  waits for the end of the month, where the central committee of Toyota will go through all the solutions and decide on what to fund and staff a team for.
